And given that they both spend a lot of time thinking about and exploring theories, they can definitely have super insightful, engaging conversation.

Since these types are both intuitive feelers, they have the awe-inspiring ability to sense each other’s moods, desires, and needs with ease, and then care for each other accordingly. This is helpful given that the ENFJ — aka The Giver — is prone to forgetting to take care of their own needs. It will be nearly effortless for these two types to become in tune with each other, and since they’re both skilled communicators, they’re able to avoid misunderstandings and handle issues with ease (which is saying a lot for the conflict-hating ENFJ).

These two types make a great team because they’re both sensing personalities, meaning that they tend to focus on the here and now and make decisions based on the facts rather than their feelings or intuition. Best of all, these personalities complement each other in a number of unique ways.

An ESTP is often attracted to the ISFJ’s dependable, nurturing nature, while the ISFJ is sucked in by the ESTP’s charisma and sense of adventure. Both are sensing types, so they pay attention to detail, which means they’re more likely to make choices and respond to situations in a similar fashion — based on knowledge from past experiences, as well as present facts.

While the ISFP can be a bit scattered (it comes with the territory of being incredibly creative), the ESFJ is wonderfully patient, and are able to appreciate their partner’s artistic sensibilities while also helping to bring a little order to their lives (which they usually appreciate).

These shared traits allow them to better understand each other and potentially avoid some conflict because they can be super direct without having to worry about offending each other. Besides, their differences only make them a stronger team.

The ENTP is a pro at getting the slightly guarded INFJ to come out of their shell, while the INFJ is able to help the ENTP improve their organizational skills.

They can engage in candid conversations about their problems, because neither type is overly sensitive — so they don’t have to sugar coat their thoughts to avoid hurting each other’s feelings.
